Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday wished the nation on the 77th Independence Day and said a new world order is in the works after the pandemic, similar to the one brought about by the end of World War II. He said that India now identified as a ‘Vishwamitra’ and also announced the launch of the Vishwakarma Yojana for barbers and goldsmiths with an initial spending of Rs. 13,000-15,000 crore.

Referring to the Manipur crisis, PM Modi said that a path to a solution in the northeastern state will be found through peace. PM Modi also said his government has changed the thinking about border villages through its ‘Vibrant Villages’ scheme. “The village on the border is not India’s last village, as was said before, it is the first village of the country,” he said.



Here is the full text of his speech:

My beloved 140 crore family members,

World’s biggest democracy and in the context of population as well, we are trusted for being number one. Such a humongous nation is today celebrating the festival of independence with its 140 billion brothers and sisters and all family members. On this momentous and sacred occasion, I extend my greetings to each and every citizen of the country, to each one who loves, respects and takes pride in our nation India.

My dear family members,

The Non-cooperation/Civil Disobedience and Satyagraha Movement under the leadership of our ‘pujyaBapu’ revered Mahatma Gandhi ji, bravehearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, and their generation, there will hardly be any person who has not contributed to the independence of the country. Today I respectfully pay homage to all those who contributed and sacrificed their lives during our freedom movement. I humbly bow down to their penance in giving us a free nation.

Freedom Sale
Today, 15th August, is also the 150th birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo, the great revolutionary and pioneer of spiritual life. It is also the 150th birth anniversary of Swami Dayanand Saraswati ji. This year our nation is going to celebrate with great fervor, the 500th birth anniversary of the iconic women warrior Rani Durgawati. We will also be remembering the premier of ‘bhakti and yog’ Meerabai, on the occasion of 525th years of her life immersed in spiritualism. Our country will be celebrating a milestone of 75th year on next 26th January which is our Republic Day. There will not be a bigger day to commit to national development, with new inspirations, new consciousness, new resolutions, as the country opens up immense possibilities and opportunities.

My dear family members,

Unfortunately, this time the natural calamity created unimaginable distress in many parts of the country. I express my condolences to all the families who have suffered in this crisis and assure that the state in tandem with the central government will leave no stone unturned to stand by you and resolve all those troubles at the earliest.

My dear family members,

In the past few weeks, particularly in Manipur in the North-East, and in some other parts of India, there has been a spell of violence, where many people lost their lives, and the dignity of mothers and daughters was violated. However, in the last few days, we have been hearing continuous reports of peace, and the entire nation stands with the people of Manipur. The people of Manipur have maintained peace in the past few days, and they should continue to foster that peace, as it is the path to resolution. Both the state and central governments are working together to find solutions to the issues and will continue to do so.

My dear family members,

When we look back at history, there are moments that leave an indelible mark, and their impact lasts for centuries. Sometimes, these events might seem small and insignificant at the beginning, but they lay the roots for numerous problems. We all know that our country was invaded 1000-1200 years ago. A small kingdom and its king were defeated. However, we couldn’t have known that this event would lead India into a thousand years of subjugation. We got ensnared in slavery, and whoever came, looted us, and ruled over us. What an adverse period it must have been, that thousand-year span.

My dear family members,

An event might seem small, but its effects can persist for a thousand years. Today, I want to mention this because during this phase, India’s brave souls from across the country continued to keep the flame of freedom burning, and establish a tradition of sacrifice. Mother India stood up to break chains, to shatter shackles, and the women power, youth power, farmers, and people from villages, workers and every Indian who lived, breathed, and strived for the dream of freedom was ready. A formidable force was ready for sacrifices to attain freedom. Numerous great souls, who spent their youth in prisons, were relentlessly striving to break the chains of slavery and for the freedom of the country.

My dear family members,

That widespread consciousness, the all-encompassing form of sacrifice and penance, instilled a new belief in the hearts of the masses, and in 1947, the country finally achieved independence, fulfilling the dreams nurtured during a thousand years of subjugation.

Friends,

I am talking about the events of a thousand years ago for a reason. I am witnessing another opportunity before our country, a time when we are living in such a period, when we have entered such an era. It is our good fortune that either we are living in youth or we have taken birth in the lap of Mother India in the first year of ‘Amrit Kaal’. And mark my words, my dear family members, the actions we take, the steps we take, the sacrifices we make, the penance we undertake in this era will define our legacy.

Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay; We will take decisions one after the other, and the golden history of the country for the next 1000 years is going to emerge from it. The events taking place in this period are going to impact the next 1000 years. The country, which has come out of the slave mentality and is dedicated to the ‘Panch-Pran’ or the five resolutions, is moving forward today with a new self-confidence. The nation is working wholeheartedly to fulfil the new resolutions. My Mother India which was once a powerhouse of energy, but was buried underneath a pile of ashes, has been awakened once again by the efforts, consciousness and energy of 140 crore countrymen. Maa Bharti has been awakened and we have experienced in the last 9-10 years that this is the period in which a new trust, a new hope and a new attraction has emerged all over the world towards India, towards the potential of India, and the world can see a spark for itself in this beam of light that is emanating from India. A new trust is growing around the world.

We are fortunate that we have inherited certain things from our ancestors and even the present era has created certain other things. Today we have demography; we have democracy; we have diversity. This trinity of demography, democracy and diversity has the potential to fulfill every dream of India. Today, while the countries around the world are witnessing an age structure that is growing old, India is moving energetically towards its youthful age structure. It is a period of great pride because today India has the highest population under the age of 30. This is what we have in my country, the youth below the age of 30 years; my country has crores of hands, crores of brains, crores of dreams, crores of resolutions! So, my brothers and sisters, my family members, we can get the desired results.

My dear family members,

Such incidents change the fate of the country. This power changes the destiny of the country. We are at the milestone between 1000 years of slavery and 1000 years of grand future that is about to come. We are at this crossroads and hence we cannot stop, nor shall we live in a dilemma anymore.

My dear family members,

Taking pride in the heritage that was once lost, gaining back the lost prosperity, let us once again believe that whatever we do, whatever step we take, whatever decision we make, will determine our direction for the next 1000 years and will write the fate of India. Today I would like to tell the youth of my country, to the sons and daughters of my country, you are fortunate. People hardly get the kind of opportunity that our youngsters are getting now,and so we don’t want to lose it. I have utmost faith in our youth power. There is huge potential/capability in our youth power and our policies as well as our ways provide an enabling environment to strengthen it.

Today my youth have propelled India to a certain position in the world’s first three startup economy systems. The youth of the world are amazed to see this power of India. Today the world is technology driven and the coming era is going to be influenced by technology. This gives a platform to showcase the prowess of India’s talent in technology who is going to play a new key role.

Friends,

Recently, I went to Bali for the G-20 Summit and there the premiers of the most prosperous and developed countries of the world showed immense curiosity and were so eager to learn about the nuances and the success of our Digital India.They were in awe of our talent when I shared that this wonder that India has achieved was not limited to the efforts made by youth of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai but also by the youth of my Tier-2, Tier-3 cities. Today they are shaping the fate of my country. Today my youth from even small places, and I say this with great confidence today, that this new potential of the country is visible. That is why I say that our small cities can be smaller in size and population but the hope and aspirations, effort and impact they have demonstrated are second to none. They have novel ideas to develop apps, provide solutions and design technological devices. Just look how our sports world has evolved. The children who came out of the slums are showing might in the world of sports today. The youth of small villages, small towns, our sons and daughters are achieving wonders today in this arena.Now see, there are 100 schools in my country where children are making satellites and also aspiring to release them one day. Today thousands of tinkering labs are conceiving new scientists. Today, thousands of tinkering labs are inspiring millions of children to take up the path of science and technology.

I want to tell the youth of my country that today there is no dearth of opportunities, as many opportunities as you want, this country is capable of creating more opportunities. Sky’s the limit.

Today, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I want to heartily congratulate the mothers, sisters and daughters of my country. Our country has reached a level today due to the special prowess and competence of my mothers and sisters. Today the country is on the path of progress, so I want to also congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters.Today I bow down to the laborers of my country, my laborers who are my dear family members and all the several crores who belong to these fraternities. Today, the country which is moving towards modernity, is seen with a power comparable to the world. This could not be possible without the huge contribution of the laborers of my country. Today is the opportune time to hail their tireless efforts from the ramparts of the Red Fort. I truly congratulate all of them.

I honor my family members, the 140 crore citizens of my country, these laborers, these street vendors and those who sell fruits and vegetables. Professionals play a significant role in moving my nation forward, in taking India to new heights of progress. Whether they are scientists, engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, scholars, universities, gurukuls, everyone is contributing their utmost to brighten the future of Mother India.

My dear family members,

National consciousness is the term that is liberating us from worries. And today, this national consciousness is proving that India’s greatest strength is trust. India’s greatest strength is trust, our trust in each individual, trust of each individual in government, trust of each one in a bright future for the nation, and the world’s faith in India as well. This trust is for our policies and practices. This trust is because of the determined steps with which we are moving forward, towards a brighter future for India.

Brothers and sisters,

My dear family members, it is certain that India’s capabilities and possibilities are set to traverse new heights of belief, and this new belief in abilities and new strengths should be nurtured. Today, the country has got the opportunity to host the G-20 summit. And the way various G-20 events and programs have been organized in every corner of India since the past year, they have showcased the abilities of common people to the world. These events have introduced the diversity of India. The world is observing India’s diversity with amazement, and as a result, the attraction towards India has also increased. There is a growing desire to know and understand India. Similarly, India’s export is growing rapidly.And I want to say that experts from around the world, based on all these criteria, are saying that India will not stop now. There is hardly any rating agency in the world which is not praising India.

The world has begun to think in a new way after the corona period. And I firmly believe that just as after the Second World War, the world formed a new world order, I can clearly see that a new world order, a new global order, a new geo-political equation is rapidly progressing after corona. All interpretations of the geo-political equation are changing, definitions are changing. My dear family members, you will take pride that the world is seeing the capabilities of my 140 crore fellow citizens in shaping the changing world. You are standing at a turning point.

And during the corona period, the world has seen our capabilities in the way India has propelled the country forward. When the world’s supply chains were disrupted, when there was pressure on big economies, even at that time, we had said that we have to see the development of the world. It should be human centric and humane; that is when we will be able to find the right solutions to the problems. And Covid has taught us or has forced us to realize that we cannot do the welfare of the world by leaving human sensibilities.

Today India is becoming the voice of the Global South. India’s prosperity and heritage are turning into opportunities for the world today. Friends, with India’s participation in the global economy and the global supply chain and with the place that India has earned for itself, I can say with full confidence that the current scenario in India today has brought a guarantee of stability in the world. There are no ‘ifs’ or ‘buts’ now in our minds, or in the minds of my 140 crore family members, or in the mind of the world. There is complete trust.

My dear countrymen,

Now the ball is in our court; we should not let the opportunity go; we should not miss the opportunity. I also congratulate my countrymen in India because my countrymen have the ability to understand the roots of the problems and therefore in 2014, after an experience of 30 years, my countrymen decided that in order to take the country forward, a stable and a strong government was needed; a government with full majority was needed. So, the countrymen formed a strong and stable government. And the country was freed from the three-decades of uncertainty, instability and political compulsions that were gripping the nation.

My dear family members,

The country has such a government today which is devoting every moment of the time and every penny of the people’s money for the balanced development of the country; for Sarvajan Hitaya: Sarvajan Sukhaya. The pride of my government and my countrymen is connected to one thing, that our every decision, our every direction is linked to just one yardstick, that is, ‘Nation First’. And ‘Nation First’, is going to produce far-reaching and positive results. Work is being done on a large scale in the country. But I would like to say that in 2014 as well as in 2019 you formed a strong government, and that is why Modi got the courage to bring reforms. You formed such a government that instilled courage in Modi to bring reforms. And when Modi brought reforms one after the other, the people of my bureaucracy, my crores of hands and feet, who are working as part of the government in every corner of India, ‘performed to transform’ . They fulfilled the responsibility very well and when the public joined in, we could see the transformation very clearly. And that’s why this period of ‘reform, perform, transform’ is now shaping the future of India. And we are promoting those forces within the country, which are going to strengthen the foundation of the coming thousand years.

The world needs youth power, youth skills. We have created a separate ministry for skill development. It will not only fulfill the needs of India, but will also fulfill the needs of the world.

We created the Ministry of Jal Shakti. If one analyzes the composition of the ministry, then you will be able to understand the mind and brain of this government in a very good way. The Ministry of Jal Shakti is laying emphasis on ensuring pure drinking water to reach each and every citizen of our country. We are reiterating and focusing on development of sensitive systems to protect the environment. After our country braved Corona, the world is looking for holistic health care; this is the need of the hour. We created a separate Ministry of AYUSH and today Yoga and AYUSH are making waves in the world. Because of our commitment towards the world, the world is looking up to us. If we ourselves undermine this ability of ours, then how will the world acknowledge it? But when this ministry was formed, the world also understood its value. We are not ignoring the Fisheries and our big beaches. We are cognizant of ensuring welfare of our crores of fishermen brothers and sisters. They are in our heart and that is why we have created a separate ministry for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy so that we can support those sections of the society and the class who have been left behind.

There are parts of the government economy in the country, but a large part of the society’s economy is the cooperative movement. Cooperative Ministry has also been created which is spreading its network through our cooperative institutions so that the poorest of the poor are heard, their needs are met and they too can contribute in an organized way towards the development of the nation by being a part of a small unit. We have adopted the path of prosperity through cooperation.

My dear family members,

When we came in 2014, we were at number 10 in the global economy, and today the persistent efforts of 140 crore countrymen have finally paid off as we have reached the rank of number 5 in the world economy. And this has not happened just like that at a time when the nation was in the shackles of corruption had gripped the country, scams worth lakhs of crores were wreaking havoc on the economy, the country was being recognized in the governance and fragile file, we stopped leakages, created a strong economy; we tried to spend more and more money for the welfare of the poor. And today, I want to tell the countrymen that when the country is economically prosperous, it does not just fill the coffers; it builds the capability of the citizens and the nation. If there is a government that takes a pledge to spend this honestly for the welfare of its citizens, then, what outcomes could be achieved.

I am giving the account of 10 years to my countrymen from the ramparts of this Red Fort to which our tricolor stands a witness. The figures that you hear tell a compelling story of change, and you may wonder how this was achieved, how powerful is our capability to facilitate such a transformation. 10 years ago, 30 lakh crore rupees used to go to the states from the Government of India. In the last 9 years, this figure has reached 100 lakh crores. Earlier, 70 thousand crore rupees were spent from the treasury of the Government of India for the development of local bodies, today it is going to more than 3 lakh crores. Earlier, 90 thousand crore rupees were spent to build the houses of the poor; today it has increased 4 times and more than 4 lakh crores are being spent to build the houses of the poor.

First the poor should get cheap urea. The bags of urea that are sold for 3,000 rupees in some global markets, we provide to our farmers for 300 rupees, and hence the government is providing a subsidy of 10 lakh crore rupees on urea for our farmers. The Mudra Yojana, with a budget of over 20 lakh crore rupees, has provided opportunities for self-employment, businesses, and ventures for the youth of our country. About eight crore people have started new businesses, and it’s not just eight crore people who started their businesses; each entrepreneur has provided employment to one or two individuals. The capability to provide employment to 8-10 crore new individuals has been achieved through the Mudra Yojana availed by eight crore citizens.

During the Corona crisis, MSMEs were supported with nearly 3.5 lakh crore rupees, preventing them from sinking and providing them strength. Under the “One Rank One Pension” initiative, which was a tribute to our soldiers, 70,000 crore rupees from India’s treasury has reached them. The families of our retired soldiers have got this money. These are just a few examples and I don’t want to take more time. There are many more initiatives that have significantly contributed to the country’s development, generating employment in various corners of the nation as the budget has been increased manifold across categories as compared to before.

And my dear loved ones,

But that’s not all; the result of all these efforts is that in my first five-year term, 13.5 crore of my fellow poor brothers and sisters have broken free from the chains of poverty and entered the new middle class. There can be no greater satisfaction in life than this.

My dear family members,

The various schemes from housing schemes, providing 50,000 crore rupees to street vendors through the PM SVANidhi scheme, and many more have aided these 13.5 crore people to rise above the hardships of poverty. In the days to come, we will launch a scheme on the occasion of VishwakarmaJayanti, benefiting individuals skilled in traditional craftsmanship, particularly from the OBC community. Weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, laundry workers, barbers, and such families will be empowered through the Vishwakarma Yojana, which will begin with an allocation of around 13-15 thousand crore rupees. We have directly deposited 2.5 lakh crore rupees into the accounts of our farmers through the PM KisanSammanNidhi. We have spent 2 lakh crore rupees on the Jal Jeevan Mission, ensuring pure water to every household. We have eased the burden of the poor visiting hospitals during illness under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. We have spent 70,000 crore rupees under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana ensuring they have access to medicine, treatment, and quality hospital care. The country is aware that we spent 40,000 crore rupees to provide free vaccines during the Corona crisis. But you will be happy to know that we invested nearly 15,000 crore rupees for vaccination of livestock to save them.

My dear citizens, my dear family members,

Jan Aushadhi Kendras have provided new strength to senior citizens and middle-class families in our nation. In a joint family, if someone has diabetes, it’s quite natural to get a medical bill of Rs 2000-3000. We provide medicines which cost Rs 100 in the market for just Rs.10, Rs.15, Rs.20 through Jan Aushadhi Kendras . And today, with 10,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country, about Rs 20 crore have been saved by these people who needed medicines for these kinds of diseases. And these are mostly people who belong to middle-class families. But looking at its success today, I want to tell the countrymen that we are about to touch that section of the society with the Vishwakarma scheme. At the same time, we are also going to work on the target of 25,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country in the coming days from the present 10,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras.

My dear family members,

When poverty reduces in the country, the power of the middle-class section of the country increases manifold. And I assure you that in the coming five years, Modi guarantees that the country will be among the top three world economies; it certainly will be. Today the 13.5 crore people who have come out of poverty have in a way become the middle-class. When the purchasing power of the poor increases, the power of the middle class to carry out business grows too. When the purchasing power of the villages increases, the financial system of the town and city runs at a faster pace. And our economic cycle is interconnected. We want to move ahead by strengthening it.

My dear family members,

The weaker sections who live in the cities face a lot of problems. Middle-class families are dreaming of buying their own houses. We are coming up with a new scheme in the coming years that will benefit those families that live in cities but are living in rented houses, or slums, or chawls and unauthorized colonies. If they want to build their own houses, we will assist them with a relief in interest rates and loans from banks that will help them save lakhs of rupees. If the income tax bracket for my middle-class families is raised from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, it benefits the salaried class, the middle class the most. Internet data was very expensive before 2014. Now we have the world’s cheapest internet data. Every family’s money is being saved.

My family members,

The world has not yet come out of the adverse impacts of Corona; the war has again created an additional problem. Today the world is facing the crisis of inflation. Inflation has gripped the economy of the whole world. We also import some goods from around the world. Unfortunately, we have to import at inflated prices. So, this whole world has been gripped by inflation.

But my dear family members,

India has tried its best to control inflation. Compared to the previous period, we have also had some success, but we cannot be complacent with that. We should not be complacent that our things are better than that of the world. I have to take more steps in this direction to minimize the burden of inflation on my countrymen. And we will continue to take that step. My efforts will continue.

My dear family members,

Today the country is moving forward with various capabilities. The country is working to move towards modernity. Today the country is working in the area of renewable energy; today the country is working on green hydrogen; the country’s capability in the space sector is increasing.

So the country is moving ahead successfully in the deep sea mission as well. Rail is getting modernized in the country. Vande Bharat Bullet Train is also now successfully plying inside the country today. Concrete roads are being built in every village. Electric buses and metro rails are also being built in the country today. Today the internet is reaching the last mile in every village as we also aspire to go for quantum computers. On the one hand Nano Urea and Nano DAP are being worked upon while on the other side we are also emphasizing on organic farming. Today the Farmers Producers Association app is being built while we aspire to build semiconductors as well.

As we work towards building an accessible and inclusive India for our specially- abled citizens Divyangjan, we are also enabling my Divyangjan to proudly unfurl our tricolor flag of India in Paralympics. We are providing special training to these players. Today, leaving the old thinking, the old scope, India is moving forward with a view to achieve these futuristic goals. And I say, when the foundation stone is laid by our government, it gets inaugurated within our regime too. I feel blessed that I was the chosen one and it was in my destiny to inaugurate and lay the foundation stones of so many projects.

Our work culture of aspirational mindset, thinking big, farsightedness, Sarvajan Hitaya: SarvajanSukhaya: Such has been our working style. And with this energy we work on how to achieve beyond and more than a resolution. We had resolved to make 75 thousand Amrit Sarovar in the Amrit Mahotsav of independence. At that time, we had resolved to make 75 Amrit Sarovar in every district. Around 50-55 thousand Amrit Sarovars were conceived. But today the work of construction of about 75 thousand Amrit Sarovar is going on. This in itself is a humongous task. This strength of manpower and water power is also going to be useful in safeguarding India’s environmental wealth. Providing electricity to 18 thousand villages, opening bank accounts for the masses, building toilets for daughters, all the targets will be accomplished with full force ahead of time.

And when India takes a decision, it achieves it. This is what our track record says. Accomplishing 200 crore vaccinations successfully was an eyeopener for the world. A 200 crore figure leaves them flabbergasted. My country’s Anganwadi workers, our Asha workers, and our health workers have made this possible. This is the strength of my country. We rolled out 5-G. My country is the fastest in the world to roll out 5-G. We have reached more than 700 districts. And now we are already preparing for 6-G also.

We have made a task force. In the renewable energy sector we have surpassed our set target. The target which we had set for renewable energy by 2030 was completed in 2021-22. We had talked about 20 percent blending in ethanol, that as well we have completed five years ahead of time. The same was true about exports of 500 billion dollars, which was accomplished ahead of time and was increased to more than 500 billion dollars.

We had a resolve to accomplish something which was being discussed in our country for 25 years, that our country needs a new parliament; now it is ready. There has never been a session of the Parliament like this that there should be a new Parliament. It is Modi who has made sure the new Parliament was ready ahead of time, my dear brothers and sisters. This is a government that works, a government that surpasses the set targets, this is a new India, this is an India full of self-confidence, this is an India that is working hard to make its resolutions a reality.

And so this India is unstoppable, this India is tireless, this India does not gasp and this India does not give up. And that’s why, my dear family members, with economic prowess our labor force has got new strength, our borders have become more secure than before and the soldiers are minding the borders.

On this auspicious occasion of Independence Day, I extend heartfelt congratulations to my soldiers who are safeguarding the borders of our nation and the uniformed forces responsible for our internal security as I move forward with the address. Our military must have a military tribunal, be empowered, remain youthful, battle-ready, and prepared for war, which is why continuous reforms are taking place within our armed forces.

My dear family members,

We used to hear every day about bomb blasts happening here and there. Everywhere, there were signs cautioning people not to touch suspicious bags and announcements were made frequently. Today, the nation is experiencing a sense of security and when the nation is secured, peace is established that helps us realize new dreams of progress. The era of serial bomb blasts is now in the past and the innocent deaths as a result are now part of history. The country has witnessed a significant reduction in terrorist attacks. In Naxal-affected areas too, there has been a major transformation, creating a conducive environment for a major change.

My dear family members,

In every aspect of progress, when we move forward with the dream of a developed India by 2047, it’s not just a dream but a resolve of 1.4 billion citizens. To fulfill that resolve, hard work is essential, but our national character is the most significant force. The countries that have progressed, the ones that have overcome challenges, all of them have had a crucial catalyst – their national character. We must further strengthen our national character and move forward. It is our collective responsibility that our nation, our national character, should be vigorous, dynamic, hardworking, valiant, and outstanding. For the coming 25 years, we should follow only one mantra which should be the pinnacle of our national character. We should move forward with the message of living the unity of India and refrain from any language or step which will cause any harm to the unity of India. Every moment, I will continue my efforts to ensure the unity of the country. India’s unity gives us strength.

Be it North or South, East or West, village or city, male or female – all of us contribute to the strength of our country with the spirit of unity and diversity. The second important aspect that I am observing is that if we want to see our country as a developed India by 2047, we must live by the mantra of ‘Shreshtha Bharat’ and characterize it. Now talking about our production, I had said in 2014, “Zero Defect, Zero Effect.” If there’s a “Made in India” product on any table in the world, the world should have confidence that there is nothing better than this. This will be ultimate. Be it our produce, our services, our words, our institutions, or our decision-making processes, everything will be supreme. Only then can we carry forward the essence of excellence.

The third point is that the additional power of women-led development will take the country towards further progress. Today, India can proudly say that if any country in the world has the highest number of women pilots in civil aviation, it’s our nation. Whether it’s the progress of Chandrayaan or the moon missions, many women scientists are at the forefront.

Today with the aim of creating a base of 2 crore Lakhpati Didis, we are working on women self-help groups. We, while promoting the potential of our women power, we are focusing on women-led development. When I put forward the matter of women-led development in the G-20, the whole G-20 group acknowledged its importance. And by acknowledging its importance, they are giving a lot of emphasis on it. Similarly, India is a country full of diversities. We have been a victim of imbalanced development. Some parts of our country have been victims of alienation. Now we must lay emphasis upon regional aspirations for balanced development and give due respect to that spirit regarding regional aspirations. If any part of our Mother India, or our body remains under-developed, then our body will not be considered fully developed. If any part of our body remains weak, then we will not be considered healthy. Similarly, if any part of my Mother India, or even a section of the society remains weak, then we cannot consider my Mother India as healthy and capable. And that’s why we need to address regional aspirations and that’s why we want to move forward in the direction of all-round development of the society, all-round development of every region and to ensure that every region gets an opportunity to reach its potential.

My dear family members,

India is a mother of democracy; India is also a model of diversity. There are several languages, several dialects, various costumes, and diversity. We have to move forward on the basis of all.

My dear family members,

When I talk about unity, and an incident happens in Manipur, the pain is felt in Maharashtra; if floods grip Assam, Kerala becomes restless. If anything unpleasant happens in any part of India, we feel the pain akin to organ donation. It is our social responsibility to make sure that the daughters of my country are not oppressed. It is our familial responsibility as well as a responsibility of all of us as a country. When copies of Guru Granth Sahib are brought back from Afghanistan, the whole country feels proud. When in any country of the world, during the time of Covid, a Sikh brother of mine sets up langar, feeds the hungry, and the whole world applauds, then India feels proud.

My dear family members,

Speaking of women’s respect, recently, I visited a country where a very senior minister asked me a question – “Do your daughters study science and engineering subjects?” I told him that today in my country more daughters than boys are taking up STEM i.e. Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. It was surprising for him to know that my daughters are taking maximum part in it. This capability of our country is visible today.

My dear family members,

Today 10 crore women are involved in women self-help groups and if you go to a village with women self-help groups, you will find bank didis, Anganwadi didis with and didis who distribute medicines. And now my dream is to create a base of 2 crore lakhpati didis in the villages. And now we have new options for the same i.e. science and technology. I can see the potential of the women in our villages and that’s why I am thinking of a new scheme. That will provide training to the sisters of Women Self Help Group with the integration of technology in our agriculture sector thereby strengthening our agritech. We will give skill training to women and train them to operate as well as repair drones. The Government of India will provide drones to thousands of such Women Self Help Groups. We will initiate making drone services available for our agricultural work. To begin with, we will start building 15 thousand Women Self Help Groups which will give flight to the dream of enabling a robust drone training mission.

My beloved family members,

Today the country is advancing towards modernity. Be it Highway, Railway, Airway, I-Ways or Information Ways, Water Ways, there is no such area in which the country is not progressing today. In the last 9 years, we have given a lot of emphasis on development in the coastal areas, tribal areas as well as our hilly areas. We have given strength to these sections of the society by introducing schemes like Parvat Mala, Bharat Mala. We have ensured the work of mainstreaming our rich eastern India with gas pipelines. We have expanded the health infrastructure by sanctioning an increase in the number of hospitals. We have also announced an increase in the number of MBBS seats in medical colleges so that our children can fulfill their dream of serving the nation as doctors. We have laid emphasis on making education accessible to all by recommending imparting education in mother tongues. I sincerely appreciate the stance of the Supreme Court of India who will now be making it possible for the people who go to court to hear the judgment and receive the operative part in their respective mother tongues. The importance of mother tongue is growing in today’s times.

My dear family members,

For those villages which are known as Border villages of our country today, we have introduced a program called Vibrant Border Village. The Border Villages of our country were considered as the last village of the country until now. We have transformed the entire thought process. It is not the last village of the country. Those visible on the border are the first village of my country. When the sun rises in the east, the village on this side receives the first ray of sunlight. When the sun sets, the village reaps the benefit of the last ray. This is my frontline village and I am happy that today my special guests in this program are 600 headmen who have come today to be a part of this important program at this historic Red Fort from these first villages, border villages. They have traveled so far for the first time and have joined with new resolve, prowess, vigor and determination.

My beloved family members,

We envisioned Aspirational District and Aspirational Block to reinstate balanced development and its positive results can be seen today. Today, with the normal parameters of the states, these Aspirational Districts, which were once far behind, have shown better performance. I am positive that in the coming days, our aspirational districts and our aspirational blocks will definitely move forward. As I was speaking about India’s character- first I mentioned India’s unity; secondly, I mentioned that India should focus on excellence, thirdly, I spoke about women development. And today, I want to reiterate one more thing, fourthly Regional aspiration and the fifth important thing is India’s national character and we are moving forward in that direction. Our national character should think about the betterment of the world. We have to make the country so strong that it can play its role for the welfare of the world. And after handling a global crisis like Corona, and the way we stood up as a country to help the world, the result is that our country has now taken the form of a friend of the world.

As an unwavering ally of the world, India has established its identity today. When we talk about global welfare, India’s fundamental idea is to carry that thought forward. I am pleased that on this occasion of August 15th, several esteemed representatives from the US Congress are present among us.

What is India’s perspective, and how do we advance the idea of global welfare? Now, when we think, what do we say? We have presented this vision to the world, and the world is joining us with this vision. We said “One Sun, One World, One Grid” in the field of renewable energy. This is a significant statement from us, and today the world is acknowledging it. After COVID, we told the world that our approach should be “One Earth, One Health”. Solutions to problems will arise only when humans, animals, and plants are equally addressed during times of illness.

We have put forth the concept of “One World, One Family, One Future” for the G20 summit and are working in that direction. As the world grapples with climate crises, we have shown the way and launched the LifeStyle for Environment – Mission LiFE initiative. We formed the International Solar Alliance in collaboration with the world and many countries are now part of the International Solar Alliance. We have emphasized the importance of biodiversity and advanced the establishment of the “Big Cat Alliance”.

For the damage caused to infrastructure due to global warming from natural disasters, there is a need for long-term arrangements. Therefore, we have introduced the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) as a solution. While the world is currently witnessing conflicts in the oceans, we have provided the world with the concept of the “Sagar Platform” which can guarantee global maritime peace. Emphasizing the need for traditional medical practices in mind, we have worked towards establishing a global-level center of the World Health Organization (WHO) in India. Through yoga and Ayurveda, we have worked for global well-being and health. Today, India is laying a strong foundation for global welfare. It is our collective responsibility to build upon this strong foundation.

My dear family members,

We have many dreams, clear resolutions, and definite policies. There is no questioning the intention. However, we must accept some truths and work towards their solutions. Therefore, my dear family members, I have come to the Red Fort today to seek your help and blessings, because in recent years, I have understood the nation’s needs and assessed its necessities. Based on my experience, I am saying that we must now address these matters with seriousness. During the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence, when the nation celebrates 100 years of freedom in 2047, at that time, the Tricolour should be of a developed India in the world. We must not pause even for a moment, nor should we step back. For this, awareness, transparency, and impartiality are the necessary strengths. We have to provide as much nourishment to this strength as possible.

It should be our collective responsibility to ensure that we can provide it through institutions as a citizen and as a family. And that’s why if we look at the history of the last 75 years, there was no dearth in India’s potential. And why can’t this country, which was once called the ‘golden bird’, rise again with that same potential? Friends, my dear family members, I have an unwavering belief that in 2047, when the country celebrates 100 years of independence, my country will be a developed India. And I am saying this on the basis of the strength of my country, our available resources and particularly trusting the power of youth, of those under 30 years of age. Moreover, I am saying this on the basis of the strength of my mothers and sisters. However, there are certain obstacles in front of it because in the last 75 years certain bad elements have creeped into the society and have become a part of our social system so much so that sometimes we even turn a blind eye toward these. Now is not the time to shut your eyes.

If the dreams are to be fulfilled, the resolutions are to be achieved, then it is the need of the hour to fight the three evils by holding the bull by its horns. Corruption is at the root of all the problems of our country. Like a termite, it has completely eaten away all the systems of the country, and all the capabilities of the country. Freedom from corruption, fight against corruption in every area and in every sector is the need of the hour. And countrymen, my dear family members, this is Modi’s commitment; it is my personal commitment that I will continue to fight against corruption. Secondly, dynastic politics has destroyed our country. This dynastic system had gripped the country and snatched away the rights of the people of the country.

The third evil is appeasement. This appeasement has also stained the original thinking of the country, our harmonious national character. These people destroyed everything. And therefore, my dear countrymen, my dear family members, we must fight against these three evils with all our might. Corruption, nepotism and appeasement; these challenges have flourished which has suppressed the aspirations of the people of our country. These evils rob our country of whatever abilities some people have. These are the things that put a question mark on the hopes and aspirations of our people. Be it our poor, be it Dalit, be it backward, be it Pasmanda communities, be it our tribal brothers and sisters, or be it our mothers or sisters, we all have to get rid of these three evils for their rights. We must create an atmosphere of aversion towards corruption. Just as dirt creates aversion in our minds because we do not like dirt, there can be no bigger filth than this in public life.

And that’s why we must give a new twist to our cleanliness campaign and cleanse our system of corruption. The government is making a lot of efforts to get rid of corruption with the use of technology. You would be surprised to know what was achieved on the ground in the last 9 years in this country. If you listen to the alarming figures, you will realize that Modi takes such steps. I stopped the unfair advantage that nearly ten crore people used to take. Some of you might claim that severe injustice was done to these people; But no, who were these 10 crore people? Alarmingly, these 10 crore people were those who were not even born, and yet many falsely identified themselves as their widows and divyangs and reaped the benefits. Such women upon getting old often became disabled, and thus continued to take false benefits of government schemes. This is the pious task where we were able to stop 100 million such benami activities that had been going on since decades. The property of the corrupt that we have seized is 20 times more than before.

My dear family members,

These people absconded after robbing your hard earned money. We confiscated 20 times more property, and hence people’s resentment towards me is very natural. But I have to intensify this fight against corruption. Due to our faulty government system, even if something happened in the eye of the camera, it used to get stuck afterwards. Compared to earlier times, we have now filed many more chargesheets in the court and getting bails is not easy. We are progressing by building such a firm system, because we are earnestly and honestly fighting against corruption.

Today, nepotism and appeasement have brought big misfortune to the country. Now how can this happen in democracy that a political party, and I am giving special emphasis on ‘political party’, has brought such a distortion in the democracy of my country. It can never strengthen India’s democracy. What is that disease: familial politics. And what is their mantra? Party of the family, by the family and for the family. Their life mantra is that their political party belongs to the family, through the family and for the family, Nepotism and partisanship are the enemies of our talent pool. These parties deny capabilities and refuse to accept their competence. And therefore, for the strengthening of the democracy of this country we must liberate ourselves from nepotism. Sarvajan Hitaya Sarvajan Sukhay! Everyone deserves to get their rights. Hence, it is very important to reinstate social justice as well. Appeasement has done the biggest harm to social justice. If someone has destroyed social justice, then this appeasement thinking, appeasement politics. Government schemes for appeasement have indeed killed social justice. And that’s why we realize appeasement and corruption are the biggest enemies of development. If the country wants development, the country aspires to fulfill the dream of 2047 of a developed India, then it is necessary for us that we refuse to tolerate corruption in the country under any circumstances. We should walk forward and onward with this mood.

My beloved family members,

We all have a very important responsibility. Forcing our next generation to live the way you have lived, is a crime. It is our responsibility to give a prosperous and a balanced nation to our future generation. We should aim to provide a country steeped in social justice, so that our future generations do not have to struggle for small things. It is the duty of all of us, the duty of every citizen, and this era – Amrit Kaal is Kartavya Kaal –an era of duty. We cannot lag behind in our responsibilities; we have to build the India that was dreamt by Mahatma Gandhi, the India that was the dream of our freedom fighters, the India that was the dream of our brave martyrs, our brave women, who sacrificed their lives for the motherland.

My dear family members,

When I came in 2014, I came with a promise of change. In 2014. I made a promise to you that I will bring about change. And the 140 crore members of my family placed their trust in me, and I made every effort to fulfill that trust. The promise of Reform, Perform, Transform changed into belief because I had promised change. Through Reform, Perform, Transform, I have turned this promise into belief. I have worked tirelessly, I have worked for the country, I have worked with pride, and I have done it with the spirit of “Nation First.” Based on my performance, you blessed me once again in 2019 and the promise of change brought me here. The next five years will be the years of unprecedented development. The next five years are the golden moments to realize the dream of 2047. And next time, on the 15th of August, from this very Red Fort, I will present to you the achievements of the country, your capabilities, the progress made by you, the successes achieved with even greater self-confidence.

My dear loved ones,

I come from amongst you, within your midst and I live for you. If I have a dream, it is for you. If I sweat, it is for you. Not because you have entrusted me with this responsibility, but because you are my family. As a member of your family, I cannot bear witness to any of your sorrows, I cannot bear to see your dreams shattered. I am here to fulfill your resolutions, to stand by you as a companion, to serve you, to be connected with you, to live with you, and to fight for you. I am a person who has embarked on this journey with determination, and I believe that the struggles undertaken by our ancestors for independence and the dreams they had are with us today. The blessings of those who made sacrifices during the struggle for independence are with us. An opportunity has come for the 140 crore citizens of our country, and this opportunity has come with great potential and strength for us.

And therefore, my dear loved ones,

Today, as I converse with you in this ‘Amrit Kaal’, in the first year of the ‘Amrit Kaal’, I want to tell you with complete confidence –

As the wheel of time keeps turning,

The ever revolving cycle of the Amrit Kaal,

Everyone’s dreams are my own dreams,

Nurturing all the dreams, moving steadily, bravely marching, our youth in stride,

With the right principles, forging a new way, setting the right pace, a new path,
